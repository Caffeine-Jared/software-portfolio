# Overview

Data science is what I consider the fun side of programming, there is so much to learn and so many different ways to approach a problem. I have always been interested in data science and I am excited to learn more about it.

# Data Analysis Results

How can analyzing sales data for homes built pre-1980s and post-1980s, and leveraging the latest data science techniques, help predict future home sales trends in Denver and lead to more informed decisions and better outcomes for real estate professionals and homeowners?

Answer: 
There are many trends that can be found in the data that I have analyzed. Some of the trends that I have found are that newer homes are more likely to have bigger basements which are finished while older homes are more likely to have unfinished basements. It seems that people who buy new homes are willing to pay a premium for a finished basement, and other upgrades found within new constructions.


And what type of homes would I consider buying if I were to buy a home in Denver? (This is a personal question that I am trying to answer - pre-1980s or post-1980s)

Answer:
Given the data that I have analyzed, I would consider buying a home built after 1980. I would consider buying a home built after 1980 because of the many benefits that come with having a newer home. Some of the benefits that come with having a newer home are that newer homes are more energy efficient, have better insulation, and are more likely to have modern amenities. 

Additionally, having a single family home is much more convient than having to share a building with other people.

# Development Environment

I used Python to analyze the data. I used the pandas library to read the data and the seaborn library to visualize the data. Additionally, I used juypter notebook to write the code and run the code, which helped immensely with the development process. Anaconda was used to install the libraries and juypter notebook.

Python for data sceince was a great resource for learning how to use the libraries and how to analyze the data.

# Future Work

I want to be able to include machine learning into data science and figure out how it works with existing data science techniques. I also want to learn more about data science and how to use it to solve real world problems.
