# Overview

This is a single main program that showcases my different projects that I made throughout learning C#. The program allows the user to run their specified project through the console. Overall, this also showcases my skills at the beginning of the process versus my skills now.

# Development Environment

Getting the right tools for C# is one of the harder parts of getting into C# development from my expereince. I used VScode, and the dotnet 6.0/7.0 sdk to run my projects and debug certain issues.

For most of my programs I decided to use minimal libraries as I was learning and jumping into libraries so early on would've been difficult. But I plan to incorporate more libraries into my projects in the future.

# Future Work

Something that I'd like to fix about my programs is to increase the functionality of the calculator function/class. I started work on it, but still have a while to go before I get it to run without issues. 

- Fix Calculator function to provide more functionality
- Make a function that allows a user to find the vertex of a parabola
- Learn more! :)
