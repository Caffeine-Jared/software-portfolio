# Overview

The web app that I wrote is a simple calculator and color picker application. The calculator allows users to input mathematical expressions and perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The color picker allows users to select a color from a predefined set of colors or choose a custom color using a color wheel.

Creating a calculator is always a good exercise for learning about basic algorithms and data structures, as well as event handling and user input. Meanwhile, building a color picker was an opportunity to learn about front-end web development and user interface design, as well as more advanced topics like color theory and data visualization.

This web app is a practice in using React.
