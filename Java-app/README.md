# Overview
The address book application showcases Java programming fundamentals, including object-oriented principles, data structures, and user input handling. This project allowed me to reinforce my Java knowledge while creating a practical and functional tool.

The primary purposes of writing this software were to gain hands-on experience with Java programming, apply software engineering principles in a practical context, and create a foundation for future, more complex Java projects.
